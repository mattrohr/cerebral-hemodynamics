## Purpose
Among the top 10 leading causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be slowed, prevented, or cured. Research to-date has focused on understanding neuron pathways, medicinal treatment, and behavior assessment. These approaches are either invasive, expensive, or catch the disease at a late stage.

Because the brain's neural circuits and vascular network are coupled, **changes in brain blood flow may predate symptoms**. To examine this hypothesis, **our approach measures brain blood flow at various states of neurodegeneration**. If proven, an individual's vascular response to stimulation can be measured without incision, and such diagnostic procedures would be widely deployable. 

## Install 
LabVIEW 19.0+ 32-bit, LabVIEW IMAQdx 19.0+ ([check compatibility](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/documentation/compatibility/17/vision-acquisition-software-and-labview-compatibility.html)), LabVIEW DAQmx 19.0+ ([check compatibility](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/documentation/compatibility/16/ni-daqmx-and-labview-compatibility.html#:~:text=Additional%20Resources-,NI%2DDAQmx%20Compatibility%20with%20LabVIEW%20Service%20Packs,and%20also%20LabVIEW%202015%20SP1.)), MATLAB 9.7+ (i.e. R2019b), and [Andor Software Development Kit 3.0](https://andor.oxinst.com/products/software-development-kit/software-development-kit) (select 32-bit option during installation, to match LabVIEW bitness) are dependencies.
