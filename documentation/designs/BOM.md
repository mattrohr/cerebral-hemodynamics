### Tenative Modifications
```diff
! Thorlabs DFM1 Kinematic Filter Cube and M1-DCH Dichroic Cage Cube have play, so Laserglow R471003FX's angle of incidence on Semrock FF505 beamsplitter is outside angle of acceptance.
- Thorlabs DFM1 Kinematic Filter Cube
+ Thorlabs B3CR Cage Cube Rotation Platform 
+ Thorlabs C6W Cage Cube
+ Thorlabs FFM1 Rectangular Filter Mount
# B3CR rotates only the FFM1-mounted optic inside of the C6W, allowing for fine tuning of angle of incidence.

! Dell Optiplex 7060 Tower has run out of PCI-Express Lanes, so it can't accept Myricom 10-Gigabit Ethernet Network Interface Card for simultaneous measurement of blood-relative-velocity (i.e. LSCI).
+ 1 of Dell Optiplex 7060 Tower
# It's possible to synchronize two PCs within a *.lvprj, or so I've been told.

! Currently using a 50:50 coupler: 50% of light goes down the sample arm of the interferometer and remaining 50% goes down reference arm.
- Thorlabs FC1310-70-50-APC 2x2 Broadband SM Coupler, 1310 ± 70 nm, 50:50 Split
+ Thorlabs TW1300R2A2 2x2 Wideband Fiber Optic Coupler, 1300 ± 100 nm, 90:10 Split
# Shooting 50% of light down the reference arm is overkill, and we'd rather have ~40% more signal from the sample.

! Blue light from the stimulation laser is hitting the Zyla sensor.
- Semrock FF505-SDi01-25x36 505-nanometer Dichroic Beamsplitter
+ Semrock FF496-SDi01-25x36x2.0 496-nanometer Dichroic Beamsplitter
# Swapping beamsplitter would further decrease sample-reflected blue light by ~5%, red by ~2%, green by ~2%. Good tradeoff between signal and noise reduction. Also, OCT alignment laser is still visible with this new filter, which allows us to map OCT field of view with the Zyla's.
